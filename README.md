# CIS 3110-Client-Side Programming Language
Team assignment 1
Total Points:100
Due Date of Submission: September 26th, 2021, till midnight

For each team members, please prepare one page with the following features:

Each team member’s page should have 

1. a dropdown navigational menu which links to all team members’ pages. 

2. a set of inputs, with text next to them. One input should ask for a numeric value, the other, just textual values. 

3. a button, which when pressed, captures the information, and prints it in the console.

4. a div which shows the output, below, in a different color text than the rest of the page.

5. a paragraph inside the div which prints a link. The link should go to one of the team member’s pages, based on a number typed into one of the inputs. For example, if the input is equal/greater than/less than a value, link to one page, if not, then go to another. Show the ability to create a link in a div, based on some logic (based on input).

6. Be sure the link you create has several CSS values for hovers, clicks and other features, and has a distinct color, to make it stand out.

7. frame each div with a border

8. be sure to place a heading on top of each page, with the name of the team member in the heading.

9. your team should use one unified CSS file, used by every page (will require some team work)

Note: Please post the page to your S3 website, then send the URL on the blackboard under Assignment 1. Every individual must post their assignment on blackboard to be graded individually.
